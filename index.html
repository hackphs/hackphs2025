                <p>Hackathons are where creative and enthusiastic people come together to build awesome projects in
                    a single
                    all-nighter. With awesome workshops and incredible prizes, hackers will learn about new tech,
                    build
                    innovative solutions to real-world problems, and share their creation with the community, all in

                    place to
                    learn how to code, hackathons are for you. If you want to learn more, see the <a

                        another. Hackers also must abide by Princeton High School rules while on PHS grounds.
